/*
 * Loop: It is a process where the single task gets repeated again and again 
 *       until the condition is not satisfied.
 *       
 *       e.g 	circle
 *       
 * There are 3 types of Loop
 * 
 * 1) while Loop
 * 
 * syntax:   
 * 			//initialization
 * 
 * 			 while(condition)
 * 			 {
 * 				//statement
 * 				updation
 * 
 * 			 }
 * 
 * - condition is a boolean value. true/false
 * 
 * - it is called as Entry Controlled Loop.
 * - Because the condition is checked first and then the body is executed.
 * - No semi-colon after the condition.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 2) do..while Loop
 * 
 * syntax :  
 * 			//intitialization
 * 
 * 			do
 * 			{
 * 				//statement
 * 				updation
 * 			}
 * 			while(condition);
 * 
 * - it is called as Exit Controlled Loop.			
 * - Because the condition is checked at last.
 * - it will execute the do block atleast once, even if the condition is false.
 * - Semicolon after condition.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 3) for loop
 * 
 * - all in one line
 * 
 * syntax :  for(initialization;condition;updation)
 * 			 {
 * 					//statement
 * 			 }
 *
